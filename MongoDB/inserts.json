      "Pour the batter into the prepared skillet and sprinkle the cocoa nibs evenly over the top.",
      "Bake until the brownie is mostly set in the center and with little resistance when you press lightly on the top, 12–15 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool slightly, about 10 minutes.",
      "Just before serving, scoop your favorite ice cream on top and drizzle with hot fudge sauce."
